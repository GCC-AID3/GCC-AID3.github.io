    <h1>The Gulf Coast Consortia (GCC) AI in Drug Discovery and Development (AID3)</h1>
    <p>The Gulf Coast Consortia (GCC)-Innovative Drug Discovery and Development (IDDD) is a leading hub for education and innovative cancer drug development in Texas and the USA, with strong history of promoting large scale inter-institutional efforts and pre-existing collaborations among several CPRIT-funded cores across the state. In 2023, the consortium organized its annual conference with the theme of "Leveraging Big Data for Transformative Healthcare", which covered various topics related to data science and health. One of the main outcomes of the conference was the recognition of the importance and potential of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) for accelerating cancer drug discovery and development, but also the lack of accessibility and utilization of this technology. Accordingly, we are trying to address that inpart here starting with an index of useful tools for drug discovery. Cheers! </p>
